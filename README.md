Erio Discord bot!

## Terms of use
Please do not add the cogs from this bot to your own bot. They probably won't work anyways, but I'd appreciate if you'd [add Erio](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=338695256759599117&scope=bot) instead.  
Please do self-host this bot! It's open-source for a reason. I'm fine with self-hosting __just as long as your instance isn't public.__  
Do NOT host a public instance of Erio __without express permission from me, ry00001#3487.__
